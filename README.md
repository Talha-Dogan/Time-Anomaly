Time Anomaly is a fast-paced time-travel adventure told from an unexpected perspective — a caveman who accidentally breaks time itself. One quiet night, a mysterious meteor crashes into the valley. Inside it lies a strange crystal humming with unknown power. When our caveman touches it, he’s thrown across eras he never imagined.

One moment he’s trapped in icy prehistoric wastelands, the next he wakes up in futuristic cities ruled by advanced machines. With every jump, time becomes more unstable — and the only way forward is to survive, adapt, and uncover the truth behind the crystal.

Travel through shifting timelines, face enemies from different ages, solve environmental puzzles, and fight using anything from Stone Age tools to high-tech gear. Every decision you make influences future worlds and shapes the chaos ahead.

Time Anomaly is an adventurous journey through broken timelines — and only you can restore balance before time collapses for good.
